      <h1 class="fancyH1">What is a Workshop?</h1>
      <p>
        At the Summit, there will be a range of inspiring workshops on which
        attendees will have the opportunity to sign up for. A workshop is a
        45-50 minute meeting at which a leader engages with a group of people in
        an activity/discussion on a particular subject/project
      </p>

      <h1 class="fancyH1">Workshop Planning Form:</h1>
      <p>
        Filling out this
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://mismunich.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/MISCommunity/EedXdsXYIU1KjGLhsCx6sYsBbXYrRCn-3hU-AL6XLr7ecA?e=PedbnH"
          >Workshop Planning Form</a
        >
        will be the first step. The form is devised as a planning tool so that
        the intention of your workshop is clear and it helps when organising the
        details. Before we approve a workshop at the Summit, we will make sure
        that all the planning and everything else needed is in order.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the form is completed and ready for submission, please share it
        with
        <a href="mailto:alina_schoeller@mis-munich.de"
          >alina_schoeller@mis-munich.de</a
        >
        and
        <a href="mailto:solutionarysummit2024@mis-munich.de"
          >solutionarysummit2024@mis-munich.de</a
        >
        so that it can be assessed and approved. Naturally, no information you
        submit will be shared with anyone outside of the workshop team.
        <br />

        <span style="font-weight: 700">Deadline: 31st of March 2024</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        In April, additional details, including the specific date and time for
        your workshop, will be sent.

      <h1 class="fancyH1">Example of a Workshop:</h1>
      <p>
        Workshop Title: Authors of your destinies: realizing the leader within.
        <br />
        Workshop Leader: Andrew Watson CEO, Sustainability Education (SusEd)
        <a href="www.sused.org">www.sused.org</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        Blurb: <br />
        The planet and its people face a polycrisis of unprecendented scale,
        urgency and complexity. Consider education as a part of the problem -
        today's leadership, who all went to school, have got us into this - but
        also part of the solution. Only radical reform of the way tomorrow's
        leaders experience education will prepare students for the challenges
        they are already facing. In this session we will reflect on the choice
        that schools have whether to be the mirror or the change agents of
        society and explore ways for young people to become empowered as
        changemakers and as authors of their own destinies.

      <h1 class="fancyH1">Frequently asked Questions:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h1>How often will I run the workshop?</h1>
          <p>
            Each workshop will be run 1-2 times depending on how many workshops
            are on offer.

          <h1>What exactly is the "Base 10 Changemakers" thinking-tool?</h1>
          <p>
            "Base 10 Changemakers" represents a concept of exponential growth in
            making a difference. Starting at 10^0 as one person, growing to 10^1
            means impacting tenfold - reaching more people, influencing a larger
            circle, or collaborating effectively. Progressing to 10^2 implies a
            hundredfold increase, expanding influence significantly - perhaps
            through forming movements. It's about starting small, growing
            steadily, and aiming for exponential impact by scaling efforts.
