            The compass is a tool developed for sustainability and systems
            thinking. It emphasizes interdependency and interdependence. We use
            this tool to understand how different topics and workshops can
            relate to these four different compass points and it gives us an
            idea of how the workshops fits into the grander scheme of the
            conference and changemakers in general. In addition, it is a common
            framework used and provides a shared language and terminology when
            discussing local and global issues, and more.

        This model is developed to help us understand the actual issue that is

        with problem-solving and finding solutions. <br />
        <br />
        First, address what the central problem is which is how you define the
        general issue, and you then work to analyze the symptoms of the issue
        which also includes its impact, etc. You then lastly identify what is
        actually causing the issue and this is also where you can develop a
        solution to the issue.
