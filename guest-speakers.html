        <p>
          Felix Finkbeiner (*1997), founder of the children and youth initiative Plant-for-the-Planet, 
          developed his vision at the age of 9 during a school presentation on the climate crisis: 
          "Let's plant a million trees in every country on earth!" This later gave rise to the Trillion 
          Tree Campaign with the aim of restoring 1,000 billion trees. To date, more than 100,000 children 
          from 76 countries have joined Felix's idea as climate justice ambassadors. Felix continues to drive 
          the foundation's work with a great deal of energy and has played a key role in expanding the 
          foundation's new technology branch. This is how the internet platform pp.eco was created, 
          which enables donors worldwide to make donations to restoration organizations. Various apps 
          launched by Plant-for-the-Planet support the work of hundreds of restoration projects around the 
          world. By 2023, the foundation has planted more than 12 million trees on the Yucatán Peninsula in 
          Mexico. In 2018, Felix was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit by Federal President Frank-Walter 
          Steinmeier and in 2019 he was appointed by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel as the German government's 
          ambassador for the UN SDG15. In addition to his work for Plant-for-the-Planet, Felix is currently 
          studying for a doctorate in environmental sciences at ETH Zurich.

          Hi, my name is Justus, and I am currently in Grade 7. In 4th grade I
          studied bats for my PYP exhibition project as I used to have a fear of
          them! Now I am their biggest fan and have constructed and installed
          the first bat houses at MIS. I have also hosted a Bat Night where we
          saw that our first bat has moved in ! Also, this year my bat project
          was one of the two projects which resulted in the school receiving the
          Eco School Award.

        <p>
          Matovu Nkoba Ismael grew up in rural Uganda, where lack of clean water
          access was a major challenge. As a student, he initiated a well
          project providing safe water to 600 households in his rural community.
          He later founded the tech startup Clawest to leverage AI for increased
          clean water access worldwide. Through collaborative efforts like the
          Finley, Nantume, Nkoba (FN&N) Well Project, Nkoba is making a profound
          impact by empowering rural and marginalized communities with clean
          water access.

          WHAT WE DO : <br />
          MAD (Make A Difference) Courses' partners with remarkable communities
          and changemakers around the world, giving them a voice and platform to
          tell their stories - which in turn inspires and educates students
          worldwide. By using interactive video technology, we immerse students
          in global issues and innovative solutions. We build curriculum around
          the stories we share to prompt greater reflection and empower students
          to take informed action.
          <br />
          <br />
          WHAT WE DO WITH MIS : <br />
          MAD collaborates with Kathryn Berkman from Munich International
          School, whose students will use the course to develop concepts of
          identity, culture, and perspective. She says : "(Before this
          opportunity arose) I was teaching systems thinking tools on my own,
          without guidance or progression.” Now, she is “most excited” for her
          students to be part of a larger community of changemakers, and have
          the support of MAD courses as her students develop their projects.

        <p>
          Climate change is one of the biggest challenges we have ahead of us. 
          There should not be any competition among us as we're all living on the same planet. 
          We know that we need to change our habits, to act differently, to build a different word.
          To succeed in this journey, we need to engage as many people as possible. 
          The BIG question is how? How do we catch the attention of people, 
          how do we help them to have a better understanding of this extremely complex subject, 
          how do we engage them to adjust their behavior?
